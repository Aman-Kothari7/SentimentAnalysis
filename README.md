# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This sentiment analysis project explores two different techniques for sentiment analysis: VADER (Bag of Words approach) and the RoBERTa pretrained model. The project also demonstrates the usage of the Hugging Face Transformers library for natural language processing tasks. It includes data analysis, visualization, and comparison of sentiment analysis results.

## Introduction

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. This project compares two different approaches to sentiment analysis: VADER, a rule-based approach using a sentiment lexicon, and RoBERTa, a pretrained deep learning model.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before diving into sentiment analysis, the project conducts exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and the distribution of reviews. Key visualizations include review counts by star rating and word clouds for review and summary text.

## Basic NLTK

The project uses NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for basic text processing tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

## VADER Sentiment Scoring

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon-based sentiment analysis tool. The project uses VADER to calculate sentiment scores for the text data and visualizes the results.

## RoBERTa Pretrained Model

RoBERTa is a transformer-based pretrained model fine-tuned for sentiment analysis. The project utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to apply the RoBERTa model and obtain sentiment scores.

## Model Comparison

A comparison of sentiment analysis results from VADER and the RoBERTa model is presented, including correlation analysis and examples of reviews where the two approaches yield different results.

## Transformer Pipeline

The project demonstrates how to use the Hugging Face Transformers pipeline for easy and efficient sentiment analysis on new text data.
